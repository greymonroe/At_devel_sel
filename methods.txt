# SLiM Developmental Model

We modeled de novo mutation accumulation in a plant-like developmental life cycle using SLiM in nucleotide-based mode. The simulated genome was 8,000 bp, split evenly into intergenic (0–3,999 bp) and genic (4,000–7,999 bp) regions. Intergenic sites used a baseline Jukes–Cantor mutation rate of 3.5×10⁻⁶ per site, chosen so that total mutations per genome per organismal cycle were comparable to empirical estimates for Arabidopsis thaliana. Genic sites used the same model but with their rate multiplied by a genic mutation multiplier M (0.25, 0.4375, 0.625, 0.8125, 1.0) to represent reduced mutation/repair in functional sequence. Within the genic region we allowed three mutation types in the ratio 2:1:1 — nonsynonymous (m2), noncoding genic (m3), and synonymous (m21) — so that ~2/3 of coding mutations were nonsynonymous.

Deleterious genic mutations followed a gamma distribution with shape 0.14 (from Plavskin et al. 2024), giving many small-effect and some larger-effect mutations. We varied the mean of this distribution for nonsynonymous sites, S, across eight values: 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0. Dominance of nonsynonymous mutations, D, was varied across 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 to span fully recessive to fully dominant effects. We thus ran 8 (S) × 4 (D) × 5 (M) = 160 parameter combinations x 4000 each = 640,000 SLiM runs.

Instead of a single Wright–Fisher population, we imposed a repeated “clonal cell growth (mitosis) → reproduce (gametes, meiosis, sexual reprodiction) → bottleneck (single seed descent)” program to mimic mutaiton dynamics traced through cell lineages across and within generations in plant meristem, gametes, and zygotes. Each simulation started from two clonally reproducing cells, doubled to form a vegetative/meristematic pool (n=16), then expanded a gametogenic pool (n-32,000), after which clonal reproduction was turned off and sexual reproduction was enabled (gametes to zygotes). Selection for a single zygote was performed and this cycle was repeated three times (i.e. three organism-like generations). Because we repeatedly bottlenecked to one individual, any mutation present at the end of the simulation was, by definition, fixed in that lineage.

# Mutation dataset

We compiled single-base substitution (SBS) mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana from multiple published mutation-accumulation or resequencing studies: Belfield et al. 2021 (n = 105), Jiang et al. 2011 (n = 128), Jiang et al. 2014 (n = 114), Lu et al. 2021 (n = 263), Monroe et al. 2022, EU lines (n = 1,670), Weng et al. 2019 (n = 1,865), Willing et al. 2016 (n = 2,495), Yang et al. 2015 (n = 316), and Zhu et al. 2021 (n = 880). We retained only SBS events; mutations that appeared more than once at the same genomic position were excluded as likely calling or reporting artifacts, and two additional sites were dropped because the reported reference base did not match the TAIR10 nucleotide at that position.

We annotated all remaining mutations to TAIR10 (genome FASTA, representative CDS FASTA, TAIR10 GFF3). Mutations annotated as intersecting with CDS, gene body, and intergenic features, and with biological gene sets from previous literature (essential: Lloyd et al. 2011; lethal: Lloyd et al. 2015; H3K4me1-enriched: Niu et al. 2021; broadly expressed/tissue breadth: Mergner et al. 2016). For CDS-mapping mutations, we reconstructed the corresponding TAIR10 coding sequence in silico, introduced the observed substitution, retranslated, and classified the effect as nonsynonymous (amino-acid changing) or synonymous.

We estimated whether the observed ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (NS/S) in specific Arabidopsis gene sets deviates from a neutral, sequence-informed expectation. To build the neutral model, we first compiled all TAIR10 coding sequences and used their codon composition, together with the empirical single-base substitution spectrum derived from A. thaliana mutation datasets, to simulate mutations in silico across coding regions. Each simulated mutation was assigned to “nonsynonymous” or “synonymous” by introducing the substitution into the corresponding codon and re-translating, thereby preserving both genome-wide codon usage and the observed mutation biases. From this large pool of simulated outcomes we repeatedly drew random samples of size equal to the number of observed coding mutations in a given gene set (e.g. all genes, essential genes, lethal genes, H3K4me1-enriched genes, broadly expressed genes) and computed an NS/S ratio for each draw, generating a bootstrap-like null distribution of neutral NS/S values. We then compared the empirical NS/S for each gene set to its corresponding neutral distribution and calculated the proportion of neutral draws that were as extreme or more extreme than the observed value, yielding an empirical p-like measure of enrichment or depletion. This framework allows us to test for selective constraint while explicitly controlling for sequence-level mutation space to generate synonymous vs. nonsynonymous changes.

After annotating mutations, we applied the hypomutation framework described in the main text to each focal gene set. For every set, we first computed an observed genic mutation rate by dividing the number of mutations in that set by the total number of genic base pairs for that set, and compared it to a reference rate estimated from all other genes (for gene–gene comparisons) or from intergenic sequence (for gene–intergenic comparisons). This gave the observed reduction factor (i.e. the apparent hypomutation) for that set. We then evaluated whether this reduction could be explained simply by a deficit of nonsynonymous mutations. To do this, we used the neutral nonsynonymous/synonymous (NS/S) ratio (either taken from the non-focal genes or from the in silico spectrum + codon–use permutations) together with the observed fraction of coding sequence in the focal set to calculate the number of nonsynonymous, synonymous, and noncoding genic mutations that should have been observed under the reference mutation rate. The difference between these expected counts and the observed counts was converted to a correction term for selection on nonsynonymous sites, and this term was added to the observed reduction to obtain a selection-corrected estimate of genic hypomutation. In parallel, we applied the same procedure separately to nonsynonymous, synonymous, and noncoding genic sites to report component-wise reductions; these component estimates were used to assess whether the signal of hypomutation persisted in silent mutation rates.
